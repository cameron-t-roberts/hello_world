# hello_world

GitHub Hello World learning guide. 

Goals are to learn GitHub workflow, including repositories, branches, commit, pull request, and merge pull request. 

This comment is being worked on in the "readme-edits" branch. This branch is an exact copy of the main branch until I started editing. 

I have added a python file to this repository as part of my learning process. There will be two changes on this branch, one to create the file and program, and one here editing the readme text. I'm not sure if its best practice to change multiple parts like this under one branch. But I wanted to see how multiple changes would look when I did a pull request.
